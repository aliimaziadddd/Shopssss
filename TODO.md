# Mobile Hamburger Menu Redesign Task

## Overview
Redesign the mobile hamburger menu (max-width: 768px) to feel luxury/editorial. Transform the side menu into a full-screen right-side drawer with premium styling, improved typography, and smooth animations.

## Current Status
- Removed the "+" icon from MENSWEAR in HTML.

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Update CSS for mobile-only side menu styling (full-screen drawer, premium background, gold accents, typography, spacing).
- [ ] Add subtle indicators for open sections (background tint, border).
- [ ] Ensure animations for drawer slide-in/out and submenu expand/collapse.
- [ ] Verify JS selectors work without removed icons.
- [ ] Test that all links point to correct pages/anchors.
- [ ] Confirm desktop/tablet layout unchanged.

## Files to Edit
- `luxury-colors.css`: Add mobile media queries for side menu styling.
- `luxury-interactions.js`: Verify accordion behavior (no changes needed if using classes).

## Requirements Recap
- Full-screen right-side drawer on mobile.
- Dark premium background with subtle gold lines/dividers.
- Plenty of vertical spacing.
- Bigger font/letter spacing for top-level items, smaller/lighter for sub-items.
- Tap entire row to expand/collapse BRANDS/CLOTHING, only one section open.
- ACCESSORIES/NEW ARRIVALS as direct links.
- Subtle indicators when section open (no icons).
- Smooth slide-in/out and height+opacity animations.
- Keep desktop/tablet unchanged.
- All links working as desktop.
